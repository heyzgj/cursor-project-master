1. **Contract-first**  
   Zod schemas in `/docs/schemas/` are the single source of truth; generate
   TypeScript types and Prisma models from them.

2. **TDD (red → green → refactor)**  
   Never implement before a failing test exists; unit tests and E2E tests must
   cover every acceptance criterion.

3. **No hard-coding**  
   Secrets, base-URLs, and magic constants live only in `/config` or
   environment variables.

4. **Definition of done**  
   A task/Epic is “done” only when all tests, lint, audit, and deploy steps
   in CI are green.

5. **Lint & security gates**  
   Ensure `eslint --max-warnings=0`, `prettier --check .` all pass.  
   Run `npm audit --production` and resolve any *High* or *Critical* vulnerabilities.

6. **Coverage gate & auto-regen**  
   *Line coverage must stay ≥ 70%.*  
   If coverage drops below threshold **or** any file inside `/docs/schemas/`  
   changes **or** the engine archives an Epic:  
   > “Create a new ‘regen-tests’ task that instructs the agent to generate  
   > fresh LLM-based tests, then re-run CI until coverage ≥ 70% again.”

7. **UI/UX compliance**  
   All user-facing components must strictly follow `docs/STYLE_GUIDE.md`. For any new or complex UI, first draft the layout or prototype and verify it against the style guide to avoid redesign later.
